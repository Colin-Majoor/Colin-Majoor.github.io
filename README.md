# A simple statistic

Let's start this story with a single very simple statistic : 
- "The number of climate-related disasters has **tripled in the last 30 years**", *Oxfam International, 2020*

This drastic increase in the frequency but also the severity of natural climate-related disasters (floods, typhoons, wildfires, etc.) arises at the same time as the reality that is climate change and its effects start to set in. 

These natural disasters are maybe the most concrete repercussions yet of climate change, and we believe that concrete consequences are far more likely to get discussions and change going.

## Question

Thus, we wonder whether an increase in the severity of natural disasters leads to a broader discussion about climate change and its dangers ? </br>
And if it does, is it the same everywhere, or are there geographical discrepencies in the effect natural disasters have on the talk about climate change ?


# Do natural disasters drive discussions about climate change ? 

Generally no, some effects are seen but they are very small (p-value ?)
But we need to dive deeper and we see that there are 3 conditions for a natural disaster to cause talk about climate change.
- Type
- Location
- Severity / intensity

# We pick specific storms and heat waves, why ?

- articles with sources linking those events to climate change

Selected events based on the apparent link in Quotebank between talk about the event and about climate change. Visual inspection of the plots + Google trends to ensure the talks are in fact due to the event and not other climate related activities (conference, strike, speech, etc.)

## Description of the events

Background story about where the events occured (maybe map if necessary)
Severity, duration, impacts, damages, deaths
How they are comparable as events.
India from April to May 2015 – No spike in talks about climate change
Europe July to September – Spike in talks about climate change


## Inspection of the data

## Description of the events

India May 2016 – No spike in talks about climate change (dropped)
July 2016 – Heat wave in the US – Spike in talks about climate change
14-28 August – Heat waves across Europe – No spike because little severity but spread out


## Inspection of the data

## Description of the events

Hurricane season in the US September 2017 – Big spike in talk about climate change
Cyclone Titli in India and Bangladesh 8-12 October 2018– No significant spike in talks about climate change (UN report causes hill in the week before the event)

## Inspection of the data

## Description of the events

2019 Dorian end of august in Bahamas, close to US but no contact – No increase in climate change talk
Typhoon Hagibis 10 October 2019 in Japan – Relatively important increase in talk about climate change (drop in baseline number of quotes)

## Inspection of the data


# Synthesis

Map of the world showing that disasters in developping countries cause less talk about climate change. (India, Bahamas)

Disasters in developped countries cause more talk about climate change.
(Europe, USA, Japan)


This is the first question we wanted to answer.
