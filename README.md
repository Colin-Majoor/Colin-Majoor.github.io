# A simple statistic

Let's start this story with a single very simple statistic : 
- "The number of climate-related disasters has **tripled in the last 30 years**", *Oxfam International, 2020*

This drastic increase in the frequency but also the severity of natural climate-related disasters (floods, typhoons, wildfires, etc.) arises at the same time as the reality that is climate change and its effects start to set in. 

These natural disasters are maybe the most concrete repercussions yet of climate change, and we believe that concrete consequences are far more likely to get discussions and change going.

## Question

Thus, we wonder whether an increase in the severity of natural disasters leads to a broader discussion about climate change and its dangers ? </br>
And if it does, is it the same everywhere, or are there geographical discrepencies in the effect natural disasters have on the talk about climate change ?


# Do natural disasters drive discussions about climate change ? 

This is the first question we wanted to answer.
